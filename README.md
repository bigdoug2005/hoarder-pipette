# Hoarder's Pipette

## Introduction.

Hoarder's Pipette is a browser extension that injects your bookmarks from your [Karakeep](https://karakeep.app)(formerly Hoarder) into your search results. This helps you avoid missing relevant information that you might have already saved in your bookmarks.

Hoarder's Pipette integrates directly with Karakeep by using its API.
